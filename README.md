Diablo 3 hero browser
===================
All the info is gathered through blizzards diablo 3 api


when you  enter your battle tag a list of all your current heroes is generated automatically by ajax on the same page you did the search. From there you can choose which hero you want to see in depth information about. By default the character name and lvl is shown. Clicking on a hero goes to the 'heroes' page which shows a more detailed view of them including heir lvl, paragon level, whether or not their hardcore, and their skills (both base and runes).

To do
-------------
show what league the character is in
show currently equipped items
add images for all skills and runes shown.
